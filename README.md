# Cargo Hold

This project is a Java desktop application w/ GUI to store items within a cargo hold

## Preface

I started building this project as a means to learn more OOP concepts. I originally extrapolated this idea from the MOOC created by the University of Helsinki. They had an exercise dealing with these concepts. So, fittingly, I made a GUI desktop application out of it. Although, I did modify a plethora of the features and added a whole new class, the original functionality is still present. 

This is my first official project in Java.
